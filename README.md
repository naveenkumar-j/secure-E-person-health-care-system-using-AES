## About project:
We live in a world where information is available in our fingertips. This has made life easy
not only for the everyday consumer but also for healthcare industry as it means that they
are able to get the crucial information that they need within a few seconds rather than
waste time manually going through a paper trail. We believe that there is a need for a
system that provides timely information while at the same time protecting the
confidentiality of the patient. The aim is to design a healthcare database management
system that ensures that unauthorized personnel can't access it. It should also enable quick
and swift access for the authorized entities. It must also have provisions for the patient to
check up on his own data. It should also contain a log book of who and all had accessed
the data. 

## Available Modules:

1. Login/ Logout Module
2. Admin Module
3. Admin Module
4. Doctor Module


## Overview of Methodology:
We are using fernet symmetric key encryption as it combines encryption along with
message authentication and a time stamp to ensure that the data is protected and that it has
not been modified. Fernet uses 128-bit AES in CBC mode, with HMAC using SHA256 for
authentication.
